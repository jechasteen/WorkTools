# Work Tools

These tools will be useless to you. If you have stumbled upon this page somehow, there might be some interesting things going on in the code here, but I doubt you will have much to do with the tailor-made tools contained here.

This is mostly an experiment to see if the VPN at work will block github pages. I think it will. But in any case, I think these tools will work best in a "production" environment. No setup needed to get at the tools. No apps to open besides the browser.
